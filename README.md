# SpoonsV2
Matthew Selkirk's Coursework for FEWD
please üêª bear with, the initial load ‚è∞ time for the application may be lengthy due to the nature of single page applications loading everything at once. a hosted version of the application can be found at [Matthews Heroku app](https://google.com/)

## üß¨ Purpose of the application
The purpose of the application was to create a responsive, single-page cookery application. Which is
expected to use JavaScript and React to create the interface.
The basic requirements for the application were that it should allow users to

- [x] search for recipes
- [x] filter them based on the ingredients they have available
- [x] view nutritional information
- [x] rate recipes
- [x] create menus and shopping lists

All of these criteria have been met by the project and an additional step of adding a backend was undertaken to match the design specification created for part A of the coursework

## üöÄ Running the application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `prerequisites` 

Please ensure that before running the application you can use node package manager to install 
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `install`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `usage`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
## Basis of the application
The application is connected to a 

## Justification of changes

Due to the lack of familiarity with backend software it was decided that a simplified approach to the database using a single table with dictionairies containing extended information. This information would have been placed in its own table and linked into their current position, however as it is not a primary concern of the coursework task it has been downgraded in priority to achieve.

Lastly I would like to say thank you for taking the time to read this ü•Ç
